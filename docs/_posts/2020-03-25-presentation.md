I gave a [presentation](http://bit.ly/analytics-2020mar25) on SHACLI to other members of the
[RENCI](https://renci.org/) Analytics and Data Science team today. Everybody seemed to like it,
so hopefully I'll be [publishing it](https://github.com/gaurav/shacli/issues/9) to
the [Sonatype Open Source Software Repository Hosting (OSSRH)](https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html)
in the next week or so.
