SHACLI is a [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) toolset built as a
command line interface (CLI) tool. It is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
and -- once published -- will be usable with [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/).
It includes tools for:
 * Validating RDF data (in JSON-LD, Turtle, XML, and so on) against SHACL shapes.
 * Generating SHACL shapes for RDF.


It was built by [Gaurav Vaidya](https://www.ggvaidya.com) as part of the
[RENCI](https://www.renci.org/) Analytics and Data Science team.

The current favicon is taken from
[*Logos for RDF Formats*](http://cygri.github.io/rdf-logos/), and
will be replaced soon.
